  <p>The <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/boscb-boston-marriott-cambridge/" target="_blank">Boston Marriott Cambridge</a> is ideal if you're relying primarily upon public transit, but parking a car is punishingly expensive.</p>

  <p>The room block is valid through Friday, August 15, 2014.</p>
  <p>The Boston Marriott Cambridge is less than fifty feet from the Kendall/MIT Red Line subway stop. Self-parking is available at the nearby Harbor Garage for rates up to $35 per day. Valet parking at the hotel is available for $48 per day.</p>

  <h3>Airport</h3>
  <p>The best airport to fly into is <a href="https://www.massport.com/logan-airport/" target="_blank">Boston’s Logan Airport</a>.</p>
  <p>From the airport, you can take public transportation (the T) to get to most places in Boston, including <a href="http://hopefellowshipchurch.org/" target="_blank">Hope Fellowship Church</a> for the ceremony and all of the hotels listed below. See the T’s <a href="http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/">subway map</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3570254,-71.0909743,13z/data=!5m1!1e2">Google Maps’ transit view</a>. We’d recommend taking the Silver Line, which you can board at the ground level of each terminal for free. You can then take the Silver Line to South Station where you can transfer to the Red Line.</p>
